// Ensure that your Tailwind CSS configuration is correct and that the purge option is correctly configured in your `tailwind.config.js` file to include all your templates.
// Check for CSS conflicts by inspecting the browser's developer tools and ensure that the Tailwind CSS classes are being applied with the expected styles, and that styles from other sources are not overriding them.
// Consider using the `!important` flag cautiously on your Tailwind CSS classes in case other styles are overriding them, but this is not a long-term solution.
// If using frameworks that work with Tailwind, ensure that they are set up correctly.

<div class="bg-red-500 hover:bg-blue-700 !important">
  Hover me!
