# Inconsistent Tailwind CSS Class Application

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not consistently applied to elements. The issue is intermittent and difficult to reproduce reliably.

## Bug Description

Sometimes, Tailwind CSS classes are correctly applied, and other times they are not.  This inconsistency makes debugging challenging. The issue seems to be related to the order of class application or potential conflicts with other CSS, but no definite pattern has been identified.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Start the development server.
4. Observe the inconsistencies in the application of Tailwind CSS classes in the browser.

## Solution

The solution is provided in the `bugSolution.js` file. Ensure that:

* Your Tailwind CSS configuration is correct.
* There are no conflicts with other CSS stylesheets.
* The CSS classes are correctly referenced and that purge is correctly configured.
